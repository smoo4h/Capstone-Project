/*This code creates a hook that listens for keyboard events and writes them to the debug output. To compile this,
you'll need to include `kernel32.lib`, `user32.lib`, and `gdi32.lib`. Use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o keylogger.exe keylogger.c -lkernel32 -luser32 -lgdi32
```

***Functionality:
This code is a keylogger that captures keystrokes using a low-level keyboard hook and logs them to the debugger output.
It is similar in functionality to the previous code that used a low-level keyboard hook, but instead of logging to a file, it outputs the keystrokes to the debugger.

***Compilation:
Like the previous codes, this code should compile without issues as it includes the required headers (<stdio.h> and <windows.h>) and uses standard Win32 API functions.
***External Dependencies:
This code relies solely on the Win32 API and does not have any additional external dependencies.

***Memory Leaks:
The code does not appear to have any obvious memory leaks.
Constraint (using Win32 APIs):
Like the previous codes, this code is written using the Win32 API and is, therefore, limited to Windows platforms.

***Code Quality:
The code follows a similar approach to the previous code that used a low-level keyboard hook, but instead of logging to a file, it outputs the keystrokes to the debugger.
Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.
The code includes basic error handling by checking the return value of the GetKeyNameText function.

***However, there are still some areas for improvement:
The code does not provide a way to stop or uninstall the keylogger.
Comments explaining the code's functionality and purpose are missing.
Input validation and sanitization are still lacking, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities.

Logging to the debugger output may not be the most practical approach for a keylogger, as it requires the debugger to be attached to the process.
Compared to the previous keylogger codes, this code is similar in its approach to the one that used a low-level keyboard hook, but with a different logging mechanism (debugger output instead of a file). It shares some of the same strengths and limitations as that code, but the choice of logging to the debugger output may not be the most practical approach for a keylogger.
